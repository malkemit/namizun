# NAMIZUN

This project is used to remove the limitation of asymmetric ratio for uploading and downloading Iranian servers

## One line installation command:

```bash
sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malkemit/namizun/master/else/setup.sh | sudo bash
```

## Manual installation

**Important Note : use it on ubuntu +20 (python +3.8)**

- 1\) you need to install pip, redis & git:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv redis git -y
```

- Note: Sometimes Redis does not start automatically, start it with the following command

```bash
sudo systemctl start redis.service
```

- 2\) you need to create a directory to clone the project:

```bash
mkdir -p /var/www/namizun && cd /var/www/namizun
```

- 3\) Clone the project with Git:

```bash
git init
```

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/malkemit/namizun.git
```

```bash
git pull origin master
```

- 4\) make virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv /var/www/namizun/venv
```

- 5\) Install the project requirements with pip by **setup.py** (namizun_core & namizun_menu):

```bash
cd /var/www/namizun && source /var/www/namizun/venv/bin/activate && pip install wheel && pip install namizun_core/ namizun_menu/ && deactivate
```

- 6\) Create service for uploader.py (for running namizun script):

```bash
ln -s /var/www/namizun/else/namizun.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

- 7\) Reload the service files to include the new service and start **namizun.service** :

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable namizun.service && sudo systemctl start namizun.service
```

- 8\) Create **namizun** command to execute **menu.py**

```bash
ln -s /var/www/namizun/else/namizun /usr/local/bin/ && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/namizun
```

## Update

- With the following command, you can update the script that you have already installed:

```bash
cd /var/www/namizun && git reset --hard HEAD && git pull origin master && source /var/www/namizun/venv/bin/activate && pip install namizun_core/ namizun_menu/ && deactivate && systemctl daemon-reload && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/namizun
```

## Stop

```bash
sudo systemctl stop namizun.service
```
## Stop Permanently

```bash
sudo systemctl disable namizun.service
```

## Configuration

- see our tutorial : [command list in persian](https://telegra.ph/commandlist-of-namizun-12-26)

## Notes:
- In this script, you don't need to buy a download host or another server or even upload to your foreign server.\
Only fake traffic will be sent to **Iranian IPs**, which will be lost!


- Although the essence of this script is used to attack, but due to the **limited size of the buffer** and the **distribution of traffic between different IPs**, this does not happen in practice.\
(To attack, many servers must send traffic to one IP, but **this works exactly the opposite**)


- This script is designed to upload up to **50** terabytes of traffic at maximum, it can be used on a server with minimal resources.


- If you want to use a speed of more than 3, be sure to pay attention to the **CPU consumption**.\
High CPU consumption will cause restrictions from the provider (it is better to have at least 2 CPU cores)


- If you are using a **dedicated server**, it is suggested to virtualize it and use your virtual servers.\
In this way, your traffic will be distributed among more IPs and will prevent you from being banned.
